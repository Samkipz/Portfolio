        Software developer with a strong interest in AI-driven automation and
        scalable web applications. I&apos;ve built solutions ranging from
        lightweight platforms to enterprise systems, using tools like React,
        Django, and cloud services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I also have hands-on experience developing AI agents (like voice
        assistants), automating workflows, and integrating low-code tools such
        as Make.com and N8n to streamline processes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What motivates me is solving real-world problems and contributing to
        meaningful, tech-forward teams. I&apos;m always eager to grow,
        collaborate, and bring value through thoughtful development and
        innovation.
